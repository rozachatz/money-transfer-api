## Docker Guidelines
The application and database are now dockerized! Let the magic âœ¨ happen by following the instructions.

First package the application into a JAR by executing:
````bash
mvn clean package
````
Then, allow the database container to finish initialization:
````bash
docker compose up db --build
````
Now you can power up the application *anytime* by just executing:
````bash
docker compose up --build
````
Note: skip the '--build' for subsequent runs.
